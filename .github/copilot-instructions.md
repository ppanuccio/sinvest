# Project general coding guidelines

## Code Style
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, section, article, etc.)

## Naming Conventions
- Use Python's PEP 8 style for Python files:
  - Use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods
  - Use PascalCase for class names
  - Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Code Quality
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose
- Include helpful comments for complex logic
- Add error handling for user inputs and API calls
- Use domain driven design principles where applicable
- Always apply SOLID principles
- Every time you add a new feature, write unit tests to cover it
- Ensure code is modular and reusable
- Assure that after every change all tests pass successfully
